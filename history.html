    <!-- Chosen Palette: Parisian Café (Warm neutrals like beige/cream, with dark brown text and muted red/blue accents) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, non-linear SPA. The core is an interactive map of key venues, supplemented by a filterable gallery of notable figures, a visual timeline, and a comparative chart of café personalities. This structure encourages exploration and discovery over passive reading, making the rich history of Vavin more engaging and digestible for a general audience. Navigation is handled by a sticky header for easy access to all sections. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Locations: Interactive HTML/CSS diagram instead of a map. Goal: Explore. Interaction: Click to show info panel. Justification: Simpler, more focused on key sites. 2. Figures: Filterable HTML grid. Goal: Organize/Inform. Interaction: Click for details. Justification: Allows users to focus on specific disciplines. 3. Café Comparison: Chart.js Radar Chart. Goal: Compare. Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Visually represents the distinct "personality" of each café described in the text. 4. Timeline: Interactive HTML/CSS component. Goal: Show Change. Interaction: Click to reveal era summary. Justification: Provides clear historical context. CONFIRMED: No SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
